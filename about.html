				<h2>College on a Budget 
    		   -The Real, The Ratchet, The Reckless</h2>

				<p>Students taking out loans, and the struggle getting realer with every semester beginning and ending, many of us are trying to find every damn way to cope and survive. Especially in cities like New York and San Fransisco, the struggle can be exceptionally real, given the rising costs of rent, public transportation (damn, MTA) and living expenses. This blog was inspired by the experiences of college students in New York and their stories of how to go to school, work, enjoy the college experience, all whilst being on the lowest of budgets. Not only is this a place to record the history of the new era of the American college experience, but to share the victories, and losses, of how we made it through.</p>

				<h2>How we started</h2>
				<br>

				<p id="us"> Shortly after meeting on the first day of college  freshman year, we became best friends over sharing textbooks and $1 pizza. Since then, root of our friendship - our shared experiences of coming from a lower middle class family and struggling through college has become infrangible. We began supporting each other mentally and sometimes finacially when things seemed impossible. Outside of our clique, we realized alot of other students do not recieve the same support. And then we thought to create an online community to help others. We are Brittany, Niko, and Andrew, your average twenty something year olds trying to figure out how be an adult in a crazy world.
